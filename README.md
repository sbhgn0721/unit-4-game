# unit-4-game
create a crystal collect game, the target score is a random number between 19 and 120, and each image has a hidden value at a random number between 1 and 12. The wins, losses, and total score are 0 at the beginning of the game. By clicking each image the total score will be added by the hidden value of that clicked image. When the total score equals target score, the user wins and the wins variable will be bumped up and the game reset; when the total score is greater than the target score, the user loss and the losses variable will be bumped up and the game reset.
